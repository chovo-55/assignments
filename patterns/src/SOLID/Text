- Single Responsibility -> A class should have only one reason to change

- Open/Closed -> class should be open for extension but closed for modification

- Liskov Substitution -> you should be able to change an instance using a child and code should still work

- Interface Segregation -> splitting interfaces to more, so class is not forced to do more work then required

- Dependency Inversion -> one should depend on abstraction and not on concrete instances
